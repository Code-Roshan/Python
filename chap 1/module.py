"""
Modules are a collection of functions and variables that have been bundled together in a single file. This file can be imported into other python files and used to access the functions and variables defined in the module. This allows you to reuse code across multiple files and projects, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.
pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage third-party libraries and modules. You can use pip to install modules from the Python Package Index (PyPI) by running the following command in your terminal:
type of module:
1. Built-in modules: These are modules that are included with Python and can be imported directly without installing any additional packages. Examples of built-in modules include math, os, and sys.
2. Third-party modules: These are modules that are not included with Python and must be installed separately

print(""" America is known as the land of opportunity, where one could achieve anything they put their mind to, no matter who they are. Thousands of people immigrate to the United States every year from different parts of the world to have access to these kinds of opportunities. This is what is known as "the American dream". One of the many reasons America is such a great country is the diversity you see all around. America is one big melting pot of citizens from different backgrounds.

America is also home to many of the world's top colleges and universities. The California Institute of Technology is a top world-ranked college that focuses highly on science and engineering. It is located in the city of Pasadena. Harvard University is another top world-ranked college that you might be familiar with. The buildings at Harvard date all the way back to the year 1636, making Harvard the oldest university in the United States. It is located in the state of Massachusetts. University of California, Los Angeles, is another institute worthy of recognition. Located next to Hollywood, UCLA has distinguished itself as a prestigious and selective university due to the number of people who apply for admission throughout the United States. The universities mentioned are but a few of the many other excellent schools that make the United States so outstanding.

America is also known for being at the forefront of freedom and equality. Although our history may be contradictory to these ideals, we have progressed and now live in a land of equal opportunity. Whether you wish to become a doctor, a lawyer, or a librarian, America is the best place to be at to achieve these dreams.   """);
